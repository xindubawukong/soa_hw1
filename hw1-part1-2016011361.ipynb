    "\n",
    "One of the most common uses of data is to predict what users want.  This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  In this assignment, you'll explore how to recommend movies to a user.  We'll start with some basic methods, and then use machine learning to make more sophisticated predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Spark for this assignment.  In part 1 of the assignment, you'll run Spark on your local machine and on a smaller dataset.  The purpose of this part of the assignment is to get everything working before adding the complexities of running on many machines.  The interface for running local Spark jobs is exactly the same as the interface for running jobs on a cluster, so you'll be using the same functions we used in lab, and all of the code you write locally can be executed on a cluster.  In part 2, you'll run Spark on a cluster that we have running for you.  You'll use the cluster to run your code on a larger dataset, and to predict which movies to recommend to yourself!\n",

    "Please think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you're using a small, local dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to analyze the data locally will work fine, but this will not work when you're using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will not receive full credit.\n",

    "## Exercise 0: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "a) As mentioned above, for this part of the assignment, you'll run Spark locally rather than on a cluster, for easier debugging.  Begin by downloading Spark from [this link](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Unzip and untar the file (for example, spark-2.4.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz) so you have a `spark-2.4.0-bin-hadoop2.7` folder; this folder contains all of the code needed to run Spark.  We need to do a little bit of setup to tell iPython how to find Spark (we set this up for you on the cluster machines, but you need to do it yourself when running in your local machine).  We also need to start your own `SparkContext`.  The `SparkContext` is like a master for just your application.  It requests some resources from the cluster master, and it also breaks down jobs that you submit into stages of tasks.  For example, when you call `map()` on an resilient distributed dataset (RDD; Spark's name for datasets stored in memory), the `SparkContext` decides how many `map` tasks to run, and launches the `map` tasks on the executors allocated by the cluster master.\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned about many of the basic transformations and actions that Spark allows us to do on distributed datasets.  Spark also exposes some higher level functionality; in particular, machine learning using a component of Spark called MLlib.  In this assignment, you'll use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations for you using the movie data we've been analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use a technique called collaborative filtering.  The basic idea of collaborative filtering is that we start with a matrix whose entries are movie ratings.  Each row represents a user and each column represents a particular movie (shown in red in the diagram below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know all of the entries in this matrix, which is precisely why we need collaborative filtering.  For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "![factorization](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/big-data-mini-course/img/matrix_factorization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The ALS (alternating least squares) algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constrant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.  Then we \"alternate\" and pick the best user factors given fixed movie factors.\n",

    "For a simple example of what the users and movies matrices might look like, check out the [slides from lecture 9](http://goo.gl/l4Stce).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Before jumping into the machine learning, you need to break up the dataset into a training set (which we'll use to train models), a validation set (which we'll use to choose the best model), and a test set.  One way that people often partition data is using the time stamp: using the least significant digit of the timestamp is an essentially random way to split the dataset into multiple groups.  Use the least significant digit of the rating timestamp to separate 60% of the data into a training set, 20% into a validation set, and the remaining 20% into a test set."

    "\n",
    "The UI for your application is on port 4040 on your local machine (so go to [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040)).  There is no master web UI when you run locally because there is no Spark master -- just a single worker process to run your tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are all of the operations I can do on a Spark dataset (RDD)?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click the \"RDD\" link on [this Page](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD), it lists all of the operations you can do on a Spark RDD.  Spark also has a Scala API (Scala is a programming language similar to Java); the [documentation for the Scala functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/#package) is sometimes more helpful, and the Python functions work in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I use matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of good examples on the [matplotlib website](http://matplotlib.org/index.html).  For example, [this page](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/simple_plot.html) shows how to plot a single line.\n",

    "### Why am I getting an OutOfMemoryError?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error that looks like: `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted: Exception while deserializing and fetching task: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it probably means that you've tried to collect too much data on the machine where Python is running.  This is likely to happen if you do `collect()` on a large dataset.  The best way to remedy this problem is to restart your iPython notebook (go to the main server, at port 8888 of the machine you were assigned, click \"Shutdown\" on your notebook, and then open it again) and don't do `collect()` on a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curious why you're getting a Java error when your program is written in Python?  Spark is mostly written in Java (and Scala, a language built on top of Java).  We're using `pyspark` here, which uses a translation layer to translate between Python and Java.  Your Python `SparkContext` object is backed by a Java `SparkContext` object; all operations you run on Spark datasets are passsed through this Java object.  So, if you try to collect a result that's too large, the Java Virtual Machine that's running the Java `SparkContext` runs out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python / Spark is giving me a crazy weird error!\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is mostly written in Scala and Java, and the Python version of the code (\"pyspark\") hooks into the Java implementation in a way that can make error messages very difficult to understand.  If you get a hard-to-understand error when you run a Spark operation, we recommend first narrowing down the error so that you know exactly which operation caused the error.  For example, if `rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: x[1])` fails with an error, separate the `groupByKey()` and `map()` calls onto separate lines so you know which one is causing the error.  Next, double check the function signature to make sure you're passing the right arguments.  Pyspark can fail with a weird error if a RDD operation is given the wrong number or type of arguments.  If you're still stumped, try using `take(10)` to print out the first 10 entries in the dataset you're calling the RDD operation on.  Make sure the function you're calling and the arguments you're passing in make sense given the format of the input dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I ran some code and nothing happened!\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you sure?  Some of the Spark operations will take a minute or so to run; look at the top of the iPython notebook to see if it says \"Kernel busy\".  If so, it's busy running your code.  Go checkout the Spark UI to see more about what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My code is taking forever to run.  Did I do something wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably.  In our solution code, none of the Spark jobs take more than a minute to run.  If you ran something and it's taking forever, double check that you passed in the datasets you intended to.  If all else failed, create a small sample dataset and try your code on that to make sure things are working.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you end up with a job that's taking forever, you can kill the job by shutting down this notebook (which will destroy your `SparkContext` and the associated worker process that's doing work) and then re-launching it.  Be sure to hit save first!\n",

    "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`Exception AttributeError: \"'SparkContext' object has no attribute '_jsc'\"`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to create a `SparkContext`, you may get an error that ends with a red box with text that looks like: `Exception AttributeError: \"'SparkContext' object has no attribute '_jsc'\" in <bound method SparkContext.__del__ of <pyspark.context.SparkContext object at 0x10c876890>> ignored`.

When you change to the correct path, you may need to shutdown and restart your notebook for all of the path setup to work correctly again.\n",

    "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`ValueError: Cannot run multiple SparkContexts at once`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You've created multiple `SparkContext`s, likely by executing the code to create a new Spark Context multiple times.  Either (a) use the `SparkContext` that you created earlier or (b) shutdown your notebook, restart it, and then re-run the relevant code only a single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This error typically occurs because something went wrong when trying to launch the Java backend for your `SparkContext`.  One way this can occur is if `JAVA_HOME` isn't setup properly.  If you look in the terminal where you launched `ipython notebook`, there is typically more log output that will tell you what went wrong.\n",

With `flatMap()`, each entry in the original RDD maps to a list of 0 or more entries, so the new RDD isn't necessarily the same size as the old RDD (it might be larger or smaller)."
